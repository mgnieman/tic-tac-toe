First thing I did was write the game logic in logic.js.  I have to manually enter an array, i.e. 'const array = [x, o, o, o, x, o, o, o, o]', and my code will log "true" or "false" for each of the 8 possible winning combinations (3 rows, 3 columns & 2 diagonals.)

Next I used index.html & index.scss to build the 3x3 grid, viewable in a browser.  I used some bootstrap code.
